# Legacy code

This is legacy code from the old freeacs project. 

All the classes in the dbi package will be ported to slick daos. Now its all incomprehensible raw jdbc code to do stuff that is very simple operations. 

The code in the tr069 package will most likely be ported last, if ever. Its a very stable server implementation of TR-069.
